## GENERAL OVERVIEW
This project explores how the UK government generates revenue and allocates public funds, with a focus on breaking down income sources and spending categories. By visualizing these dynamics, the project provides an insightful look into the nation's financial profile and how it directly impacts citizens.

The dashboard leverages data from InformationIsBeautiful.net, combined with other credible sources like Gov.uk and Wikipedia, to present a transparent and educational experience around government finance.

## OBJECTIVES

- Provide a clear breakdown of the UK government's revenue and expenditures.

- Illustrate how much the average UK taxpayer contributes annually and how those contributions are distributed across public services.

- Allow users to explore spending by category and country to better understand financial priorities.

- Promote financial literacy by connecting wage deductions and tax implications to government budgeting.

## DATA SOURCE & SUMMARY

- InformationIsBeautiful.net – Core dataset on UK government income and expenditure.

- Gov.uk – Official data on taxation, spending, and budget details.

- Wikipedia.org – Supplementary context (e.g., GDP and financial history).

UK Gov Income and UK Gov Outcome arrived in a long format and were reshaped into a wide format to enable more effective analysis.

Using Generative AI, I automated this transformation while maintaining strict data compliance protocols.

For the third dataset (the Take-home Pay sheet), I restructured the data into sequential columns and merged it with an additional "sankey path" dataset. This integration enabled the creation of a detailed Sankey chart, visually mapping out every step of the financial journey—from gross income to final government allocations.
